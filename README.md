# Clear signing erc7730 builder

This project as to goal to build an erc7730 json for clear signing

## How It Works

The Python/FastAPI server is mapped into to Next.js app under `/api/`.

This is implemented using [`next.config.js` rewrites](https://github.com/digitros/nextjs-fastapi/blob/main/next.config.js) to map any request to `/api/py/:path*` to the FastAPI API, which is hosted in the `/api` folder.

Also, the app/api routes are available on the same domain, so you can use NextJs Route Handlers and make requests to `/api/...`.

On localhost, the rewrite will be made to the `127.0.0.1:8000` port, which is where the FastAPI server is running.

In production, the FastAPI server is hosted as [Python serverless functions](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/functions/serverless-functions/runtimes/python) on Vercel.
